A demonstration of the many tools available for data analysis

Many of these files are useful for reference to perform statistical analysis.
Several of the files in this repository are originally from homework assignments or projects I did in class.

The file, "Statistical Methods for gathering insights from public data" is a miscellaneous compilation of analysis I have performed in service of a final project for a Data Mining Course. In this open ended project, groups were presented with a public data set and asked to clean it, then perform analysis upon the dataset. While this was a group project, I performed all of the programming used in the project, including the results upon which we based our project report and presentation.
